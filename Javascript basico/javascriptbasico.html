      <h1>Javascript basic</h1>
      <p>
        javascript basics is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
        language. javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.it is
        a small lightweight language allowing maximum flexibilty for deveelopers
        to take it in a buch of different directions. javascript lives inside a
        host enviroment ( a web browser or node server), it can be connected to
        the objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over
        them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Variable declaration</a> Javascript variables are
          containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
          coffe, the cup holds the coffe, a variable hold a value. all
          javascript variables must be identified with unique names. these
          unique names are called identifiers, var x;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Variable Assignament</a> Assignament operators assign
          values to javascript variables - our cup can now have coffe poured in
          it, giving our variable a value to hold. the = assignament operator
          assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Data types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be
          able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. there are
          six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - true or
          false; null - null aka nothing; number - 42 or 3.14159; String -
          "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array- [1, "Coding", 2, "Dojo"]; and Object -
          {first_name: "Jane",Last_name: "Doe"}
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform
          different actions for different decisions - hitting different code
          blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
          conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the
          following condition is false; else we execute this block of a code;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Loops</a> There are many differents kinds of loops in
          every programming language, but they all essentially do the same
          thing:they will repeat an action some number of times. imagine you
          have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then
          you stop. Thats a loop!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Function</a> Functions are a encaspulation of a code
          block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think
          of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting
          together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
          started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the
          right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a
          ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over
          again
